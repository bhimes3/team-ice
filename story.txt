In a town far far away, lived a little Bratwurst called Hans, trying to find his way.

To clear his mind, Hans hopped in his BMW and started driving aimlessly.

Driving aimlessly Hans crashed into a Porsche that was being driving by his high school girlfriend Matilda. 

Hans and Matilda decided to grab some food at the nearest Ratskeller, where they enjoyed a plate of Bratwurst and Apfelkuchen.

After finishing their Bratwurst, they were surprised to see a Hund happily munching on leftover Brot under the table.

Suddenly, it bit her Dirndl and ran towards a Rammstein concert that was down the block. So Hans and Matilda followed the music.
